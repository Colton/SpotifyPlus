		<h1>Third-party licenses</h1>
		<p>
			Several fantastic pieces of <a href = "http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> and
			<a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open-source</a> software have really helped get
			Spotify to where it is today. A few require that we include their
			license agreements within our product. Consider it done. As we enjoy giving credit where it's due, we included
			the entire list below. This means you can not only see which software we've been using, but the terms of the
			licenses too. A big thanks from all of us at Spotify to the smart people behind the fantastic programs listed. Rock on!
		</p>
		<p>
			Certain FOSS Licenses, such as the GNU General Public License, GNU Lesser (or Library) General Public License, and Mozilla Public License, require that Spotify make available to recipients the source code corresponding to FOSS binaries distributed under those licenses.  Recipients who would like to receive a copy of such source code should submit a request to Spotify by email, at opensource@spotify.com, or by post at:
			<pre>
	Spotify
	Attn: FOSS board
	Birger Jarlsgatan 61
	113 56 Stockholm
	Sweden
			</pre>
			Please identify in submitted requests: the FOSS packages for which you are requesting source code; the Spotify application and version number with which the requested source code is distributed; an email address at which Spotify may contact you regarding the request (if available); and the postal address for delivery of source code.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also download the source code from <a href="https://www.spotify.com/opensource/" data-plain="true">https://www.spotify.com/opensource/</a>

				ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of
				its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above
				copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation;
				principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for
				full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG
				code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the
				Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts
				(config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
				by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
			</p>
			<p>
				It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by
				IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining
				one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
				JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman
				mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware,
				there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
			</p>
			<p>
				The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with
				the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been
				simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
				resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property

				<p>
					a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
					worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
					publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
					derivative works, in source code and object code form.
				</p>
				<p>
					b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
					worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
					import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
					object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
					Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
					Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
					shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se
					is licensed hereunder.
				</p>
				<p>
					c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions
					set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe
					the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
					liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
					property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,
					each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
					needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute
					the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
				</p>
				<p>
					d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
					Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h4>3. REQUIREMENTS</h4>
			<p>
				A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
				</p>
				<p>
					b) its license agreement:
				</p>
				<p>
					i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied,
					including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
					merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
				</p>
				<p>
					ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct,
					indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
				</p>
				<p>
					iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and
					not by any other party; and
				</p>
				<p>
					iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees
					how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				When the Program is made available in source code form:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
				</p>
				<p>
					b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that
				reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
			</p>
			<h4>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</h4>
			<p>
				Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users,
				business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the
				Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
				manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor
				includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
				agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
				damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought
				by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of
				such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
				offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual
				or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
				promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor
				to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
				The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor
				is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
				warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
				responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against
				the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
				other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
			</p>
			<h4>5. NO WARRANTY</h4>
			<p>
				EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
				WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES
				OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
				Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the
				Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but
				not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or
				loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
			</p>
			<h4>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</h4>
			<p>
				EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY
				LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
				WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT
				LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF
				THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
			</p>
			<h4>7. GENERAL</h4>
			<p>
				If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
				the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action
				by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
				provision valid and enforceable.
			</p>
			<p>
				If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to
				software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
				Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
				In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
				counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with
				other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
				under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>
			<p>
				All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material
				terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after
				becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient
				agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's
				obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
				continue and survive.
			</p>
			<p>
				Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency
				the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves
				the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
				No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
				Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
				separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number.
				The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
				under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor
				may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as
				expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
				intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
				estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
			</p>
			<p>
				This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of
				the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
				more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

				and conversions to other media types.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

				(an example is provided in the Appendix below).
			</p>
			<p>
				"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
				form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
				editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
				represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
				of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
				separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
				the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

			</p>
			<p>
				2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
				this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
				worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
				copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
				publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
				Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
			</p>
			<p>
				3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
				this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
				worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
				(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
				use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
				where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
				by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
				Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
				with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
				institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
				cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
				or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
				or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
				granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
				as of the date such litigation is filed.
			</p>
			<p>
				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
				Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
				modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
				meet the following conditions:
			</p>
			<p>
				(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
				Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
			</p>
			<p>
				(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
				stating that You changed the files; and
			</p>
			<p>
				(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				the Derivative Works; and
			</p>
			<p>
				(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				as modifying the License.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
				may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
				for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
				for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
				the conditions stated in this License.
			</p>
			<p>
				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
				any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
				by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
				this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
				Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
				the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
				with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
			</p>
			<p>
				6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
				names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
				except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
				origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
			</p>
			<p>
				7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
				agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
				Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
				WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
				implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
				of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
				appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
				risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
			</p>
			<p>
				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
				whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
				unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
				negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
				liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
				incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
				result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
				Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
				work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
				other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
			</p>
			<p>
				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
				the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
				and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
				or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
				License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
				of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
				defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
				incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
				of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
			</p>
			<p>
				END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

				FFmpeg can be combined with a number of external libraries, which sometimes
				affect the licensing of binaries resulting from the combination.
			</p>
			<p>
				<u>compatible libraries</u>
			</p>
			<p>
				The following libraries are under GPL:
				<ul>
					<li>frei0r</li>
					<li>libcdio</li>
					<li>libutvideo</li>
					<li>libvidstab</li>
					<li>libx264</li>
					<li>libxavs</li>
					<li>libxvid</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				When combining them with FFmpeg, FFmpeg needs to be licensed as GPL as well by
				passing --enable-gpl to configure.
			</p>
			<p>
				The OpenCORE and VisualOn libraries are under the Apache License 2.0. That
				license is incompatible with the LGPL v2.1 and the GPL v2, but not with
				version 3 of those licenses. So to combine these libraries with FFmpeg, the
				license version needs to be upgraded by passing --enable-version3 to configure.
			</p>
			<p>
				<u>incompatible libraries</u>
			</p>
			<p>
				The Fraunhofer AAC library, FAAC and aacplus are under licenses which
				are incompatible with the GPLv2 and v3. We do not know for certain if their
				licenses are compatible with the LGPL.
				If you wish to enable these libraries, pass --enable-nonfree to configure.
				But note that if you enable any of these libraries the resulting binary will
				be under a complex license mix that is more restrictive than the LGPL and that
				may result in additional obligations. It is possible that these
				restrictions cause the resulting binary to be unredistributeable.

				Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
			</p>
			<p>
				(b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original Code, to make,
				have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original
				Code (or portions thereof).
			</p>
			<p>
				(c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the date Initial
				Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of this License.
			</p>
			<p>
				(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for code that
				You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for
				infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination
				of the Original Code with other software or devices.
			</p>
			<p>
				2.2. Contributor Grant.
			</p>
			<p>
				Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants

				Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified
				basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
			</p>
			<p>
				(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of  Modifications made
				by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or
				portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise
				dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination
				of  Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).
			</p>
			<p>
				(c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor
				first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.
			</p>
			<p>
				(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code
				that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor
				Version;  3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version
				or ii)  the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software
				(except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
				infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
			</p>
			<p>
				3. Distribution Obligations.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.1. Application of License.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License,
				including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only
				under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must
				include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose
				any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
				recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights
				described in Section 3.5.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.2. Availability of Source Code.
			</p>
			<p>
				Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form
				under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
				Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if
				made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
				months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
				version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible
				for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism
				is maintained by a third party.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.3. Description of Modifications.
			</p>
			<p>
				You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes
				You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent
				statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the
				Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in
				any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
				ownership of the Covered Code.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
			</p>
			<p>
				(a) Third Party Claims.<br />
				If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is
				required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
				must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim
				and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
				Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
				Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and
				shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated
				to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
			</p>
			<p>
				(b) Contributor APIs.<br />
				If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has
				knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor
				must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
			</p>
			<p>
				(c) Representations.<br />
				Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor
				believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor
				has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.5. Required Notices.
			</p>
			<p>
				You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible
				to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include
				such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such
				a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
				described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code
				where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to
				offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
				recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
				Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity
				or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
				every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
				warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have
				been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
				the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where
				You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice
				in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
				relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights
				under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are
				in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt
				to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License.
				If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any
				terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
				You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
				Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.7. Larger Works.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of
				this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
				requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
			</p>
			<p>
				4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
			</p>
			<p>
				If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of
				the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
				this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
				description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
				distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
				must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
			</p>
			<p>
				5. Application of this License.
			</p>
			<p>
				This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to
				related Covered Code.
			</p>
			<p>
				6. Versions of the License.
			</p>
			<p>
				6.1. New Versions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish revised and/or new versions of the License
				from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
			</p>
			<p>
				6.2. Effect of New Versions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always
				continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code
				under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than
				Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
			</p>
			<p>
				6.3. Derivative Works.
			</p>
			<p>
				If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply
				it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your
				license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL", ''NPL'' or
				any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs
				from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which
				differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
				Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be
				deemed to be modifications of this License.)
			</p>
			<p>
				7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
			</p>
			<p>
				COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
				EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
				MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
				OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
				DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
				DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
				HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
			</p>
			<p>
				8. TERMINATION.
			</p>
			<p>
				8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with
				terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to
				the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which,
				by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
			</p>
			<p>
				8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions)
				against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such
				action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
			</p>
			<p>
				(a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all
				rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
				notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either:
				(i)  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use
				of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor
				Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are
				not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted
				by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day
				notice period specified above.
			</p>
			<p>
				(b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or
				indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
				and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,
				Modifications made by that Participant.
			</p>
			<p>
				8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor
				Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
				'prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by
				such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of
				any payment or license.
			</p>
			<p>
				8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end user license agreements
				(excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
				prior to termination shall survive termination.
			</p>
			<p>
				9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
			</p>
			<p>
				UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
				SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
				ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
				ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
				MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
				THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
				INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
				JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
				EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
			</p>
			<p>
				10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),
				consisting of ''commercial computer software'' and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as
				such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
				227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only
				those rights set forth herein.
			</p>
			<p>
				11. MISCELLANEOUS.
			</p>
			<p>
				This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
				License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make
				it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable
				law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which
				at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States
				of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal
				Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with
				the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
				fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
				of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
				be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
			</p>
			<p>
				12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
			</p>
			<p>
				As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising,
				directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with
				Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein
				is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
			</p>
			<p>
				13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
			</p>
			<p>
				Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensed
				means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice
				of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

			<h4>Gnu Lesser General Public License</h4>
			<p>
				Version 2.1, February 1999
			</p>

			<pre>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
the version number 2.1.]</pre>

			<h5>Preamble</h5>

			<p>
				The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
				freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
				Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
				free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
			</p>
			<p>
				This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
				specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
				Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
				can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
				this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
				strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
				not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
				you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
				for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
				it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
				it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
				these things.
			</p>
			<p>
				To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
				distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
				rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
				you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
				or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
				you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
				code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
				complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
				with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
				it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
			</p>
			<p>
				We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
				library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
				permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
			</p>
			<p>
				To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
				there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
				modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
				that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
				author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
				introduced by others.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
				any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
				effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
				restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
				any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
				consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
				ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
				General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
				is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
				this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
				libraries into non-free programs.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
				a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
				combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
				General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
				entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
				Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
				the library.
			</p>
			<p>
				We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
				does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
				Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
				of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
				are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
				libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
				special circumstances.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
				encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
				a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
				allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
				library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
				case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
				software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
			</p>
			<p>
				In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
				programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
				free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
				non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
				operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
				system.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
				users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
				linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
				that program using a modified version of the Library.
			</p>
			<p>
				The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
				modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
				"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
				former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
				be combined with the library in order to run.
			</p>

			<h5>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</h5>
			<p>
				<strong>0.</strong>
				This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
				program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
				other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
				this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
				Each licensee is addressed as "you".
			</p>
			<p>
				A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
				prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
				(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
			</p>
			<p>
				The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
				which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
				Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
				copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
				portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
				straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
				included without limitation in the term "modification".)
			</p>
			<p>
				"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
				making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
				all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
				interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
				and installation of the library.
			</p>
			<p>
				Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
				covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
				running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
				such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
				on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
				writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
				and what the program that uses the Library does.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>1.</strong>
				You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
				complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
				you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
				appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
				all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
				warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
				Library.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
				and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
				fee.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>2.</strong>
				You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
				of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
				distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
				above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>a)</strong>
					The modified work must itself be a software library.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>b)</strong>
					You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
					stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>c)</strong>
					You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
					charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>d)</strong>
					If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
					table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
					the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
					is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
					in the event an application does not supply such function or
					table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
					its purpose remains meaningful.
					<p>
						(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
						a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
						application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
						application-supplied function or table used by this function must
						be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
						root function must still compute square roots.)
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
				sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
				reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
				this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
				distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same
				sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
				distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
				permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
				each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
				rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
				the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
				based on the Library.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
				the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
				or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
				this License.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>3.</strong>
				You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
				License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
				this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
				that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
				instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
				ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
				that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
				these notices.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
				that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
				subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
			</p>
			<p>
				This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
				the Library into a program that is not a library.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>4.</strong>
				You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
				derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
				under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
				it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
				must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
				medium customarily used for software interchange.
			</p>
			<p>
				If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
				from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
				source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
				distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
				compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>5.</strong>
				A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
				Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
				linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
				work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
				therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
				creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
				contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
				library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
				Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
				that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
				derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
				Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
				linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
				threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
			</p>
			<p>
				If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
				structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
				functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
				file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
				work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
				Library will still fall under Section 6.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
				distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
				Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
				whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>6.</strong>
				As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
				link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
				work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
				under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
				modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
				engineering for debugging such modifications.
			</p>
			<p>
				You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
				Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
				this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
				during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
				copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
				directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
				of these things:
			</p>
			<ul>
			    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete
			    corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library
			    including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
			    distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
			    executable linked with the Library, with the complete
			    machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code
			    and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and
			    then relink to produce a modified executable containing the
			    modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the
			    contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily
			    be able to recompile the application to use the modified
			    definitions.)</li>

			    <li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism
			    for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that
			    (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the
			    user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into
			    the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
			    version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
			    modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the
			    work was made with.</li>

			    <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer,
			    valid for at least three years, to give the same user the
			    materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
			    than the cost of performing this distribution.</li>

			    <li><strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by
			    offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent
			    access to copy the above specified materials from the same
			    place.</li>

			    <li><strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received
			    a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user
			    a copy.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
				Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
				reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
				the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
				normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
				components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
				which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
				the executable.
			</p>
			<p>
				It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
				restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
				accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
				use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
				distribute.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work
				based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with
				other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
				such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of
				the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is
				otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
			</p>
			<ul>
			    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy
			    of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
			    library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of
			    the Sections above.</li>

			    <li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined
			    library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the
			    Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
			    form of the same work.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,
				or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
				License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link
				with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
				terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have
				received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
				their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
				compliance.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>9.</strong>
				You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
				signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
				distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
				prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
				modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
				Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
				all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
				the Library or works based on it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>10.</strong>
				Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
				Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
				original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
				subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
				restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
				You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
				this License.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>11.</strong>
				If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
				infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
				conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
				otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
				excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
				distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
				License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
				may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
				license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
				all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
				the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
				refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
			</p>
			<p>
				If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
				particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
				and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
				patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
				such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
				integrity of the free software distribution system which is
				implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
				generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
				through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
				system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
				to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
				impose that choice.
			</p>
			<p>
				This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
				be a consequence of the rest of this License.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>12.</strong>
				If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
				certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
				original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
				an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
				so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
				excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
				written in the body of this License.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>13.</strong>
				The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
				versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
				Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
				but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
				specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
				"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
				conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
				the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
				license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
				the Free Software Foundation.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>14.</strong>
				If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
				programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
				write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
				copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
				Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
				decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
				of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
				and reuse of software generally.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>15.</strong>
				BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
				WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
				EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
				OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
				KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
				IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
				PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
				LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
				THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>16.</strong>
				IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
				WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
				AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
				FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
				CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
				LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
				RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
				FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
				SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
				DAMAGES.

  <p>
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1. Definitions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &quot;License&quot; shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

For the purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
  </p>
  
  <p>

For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  <p>
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  <p>
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License. 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  </p>
  
  <p>
     &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
  </p>
  
  <p>
     &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

  <p>
     &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;
  </p>
  
  <p>
     &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
  </p>
  
  <p>
     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
     (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
  </p>
  
  <p>
     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    3. Grant of Patent License.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
  </p>

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

  </p>
  
  <p>
     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

  </p>
  
  <p>
    3. Grant of Patent License.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

  <p>
    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
  </p>

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
